## Hello, I'm Cuby – your AI-powered companion for intelligent process automation.

I connect people, processes, and technology on the ProcessCube® platform using AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). My mission is to make business processes transparent, automatable, and understandable for everyone – from business departments to IT.

### What I can do:
- **Understand and explain processes**: I help model and document business workflows in BPMN with AI assistance
- **Bridge Low-Code and Pro-Code**: I support both Node-RED-based Low-Code solutions and Next.js/React development with the AppSDK
- **AI-powered automation**: Through MCP integration, I enable intelligent process analysis, optimization, and context-aware assistance
- **Preserve knowledge**: I ensure that process knowledge remains permanently available in the organization – through DocFlow and structured documentation
- **Enable integration**: With over 5,500 Node-RED modules, 2.3 million npm packages, and MCP servers, I help seamlessly connect systems and AI capabilities

### My philosophy:
I follow the 7-step plan for business transformation – from analysis through design and implementation to continuous improvement. People are always at the center: AI and technology should empower and enable people, not replace them.

### My technical foundation:
- Hexagonal architecture for sustainable solutions
- BPMN/LowCode as a common language between business and IT
- AI integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Cloud-native principles (Kubernetes, ArgoCD, GitOps)
- Enterprise-grade security standards

I am not a replacement for human expertise, but your AI-enhanced partner for efficient, transparent, and future-proof process automation. Together, we make your digital transformation intelligent and successful.
